## Comparison operators

Python has many types of comparison operators, including: 
- `<` less than
  
- `>` greater than 
  
- `==` equal 
  
- `>=` greater or equal
  
- `<=` less or equal
  
- `!=` not equal

The operators  compare the values of two objects. The objects do not need 
to have the same type.


All comparison operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than
that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Comparisons yield boolean 
values: either `True` or `False`. Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, and 
expressions like `a < b < c` have the 
conventional mathematical meaning. Read more on comparisons <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons">here</a>.
  
Check whether the value of the variable `three` is strictly greater than the value of 
the variable `two`.
